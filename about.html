              Hi! My name is Maggie and I work as a nurse and I am a part-time
              traveler and blogger. As a little girl I used to dream about going
              differnt places all over the world, to see iconic places and
              experience other cultures. Traveling is expensive, you either need
              to save up money in advance or you could "simply" make a living of
              your travels. I do love to travel and I wanted to do more of that,
              but I love my job, so I didn't want to stop that. So I began to
              research on how I could combine both, and now I take 4-6 trips a
              year and I get to check of destinations on my bucket list. How
              cool is that?

            I know I just said that traveling is expensive, but it doesn’t have
            to be. And with that being said, it is all about prioritizing. Not
            all trips I go on are equally long or have an equal level of luxury.
            And by luxury I mean fancy restaurants, because I love a great meal,
            high-end hotels and expensive activities. I always set goals and
            expectations in advance, so I can begin to plan my trip. Sometimes I
            want some luxury on my trips with fancy food and fancy hotel and
            other times I’m good with homemade food and staying at low-key
            motels or even outdoors!

              First of all plane-tickets can be really cheap if you have a
              flexible schedule or order them well ahead of the trip. First of
              all a google-search goes a long way. By googling you wanted travel
              you will get a lot of different offers from travel agencies,
              airlines, bus and train-companies, which makes it easy to compare.
              There are also sites that you can compare travels routes by price
              and estimated time. Many airlines have a «low-price»-calendars
              where you can get very cheap-tickets. Bus and train can have nice
              prices, you also might be able to travel further for less, so
              always check out that opportunity!

          <h3>Where to stay</h3>
          <p>
            Research your stay in advance. There are many options as hotels,
            motels, air bnb’s, bnb’s. Maybe you can use an outdoor tent or maybe
            you know someone who lives there that you can visit and have a couch
            you can sleep on.
          </p>
          <h3>What to eat</h3>
          <p>
            Great food can be expensive and great food can be really cheap. Do
            some research in advance. Book tables at the restaurants you know
            you want to eat at, so you don’t risk that it’s fully booked. Also
            make sure that you can eat spontaneously, because you can find
            little gems in back-alleys. If you have the opportunity, it is
            always nice to make some food of your own because you will get tired
            of eating out - especially if you’re traveling over time.
