          <h3>How it Started</h3>
          <p>
            I’ve always been intrigued by the lifestyle of traveling. You know,
            the people who save up money, quit their jobs and use their savings
            to travel. I could never dream to quit my job, I’m too afraid.
            Because traveling is expensive, so either you need to save up money
            or you need to make a living of your travels. But I do love to
            travel and I wanted to do more of that. So I began to look into how
            to combine both, and now I travel a lot more than I did before. On
            an average I go on 4-6 travels a year now and I get to check off
            destinations on my bucket list without fear!
          </p>
          <h3>How I like to travel</h3>
          <p>
            I know I just said that traveling is expensive, but it doesn’t have
            to be. And with that being said, it is all about prioritizing. Not
            all trips I go on are equally long or have an equal level of luxury.
            And by luxury I mean fancy restaurants, because I love a great meal,
            high-end hotels and expensive activities. I always set goals and
            expectations in advance, so I can begin to plan my trip. Sometimes I
            want some luxury on my trips with fancy food and fancy hotel and
            other times I’m good with homemade food and staying at low-key
            motels or even outdoors!
          </p>

          <h2>101 on How to travel</h2>
          <p>
            First of all plane-tickets can be really cheap if you have a
            flexible schedule or order them well ahead of the trip. First of all
            a google-search goes a long way. By googling you wanted travel you
            will get a lot of different offers from travel agencies, airlines,
            bus and train-companies, which makes it easy to compare. There are
            also sites that you can compare travels routes by price and
            estimated time. Many airlines have a «low-price»-calendars where you
            can get very cheap-tickets. Bus and train can have nice prices, you
            also might be able to travel further for less, so always check out
            that opportunity!
          </p>
          <h3>Where to stay</h3>
          <p>
            Research your stay in advance. There are many options as hotels,
            motels, air bnb’s, bnb’s. Maybe you can use an outdoor tent or maybe
            you know someone who lives there that you can visit and have a couch
            you can sleep on.
          </p>
          <h3>What to eat</h3>
          <p>
            Great food can be expensive and great food can be really cheap. Do
            some research in advance. Book tables at the restaurants you know
            you want to eat at, so you don’t risk that it’s fully booked. Also
            make sure that you can eat spontaneously, because you can find
            little gems in back-alleys. If you have the opportunity, it is
            always nice to make some food of your own because you will get tired
            of eating out - especially if you’re traveling over time.
